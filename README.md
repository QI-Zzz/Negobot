To implement the price bargain chatbot, we will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. Chatbot:
   - `process_message(message: str) -> str`: This method processes the user's message and returns the bot's response.

2. IntentClassifier:
   - `classify_intent(message: str) -> str`: This method uses ChatGPT to classify the user's intent based on their message.

3. DatabaseManager:
   - `save_conversation(conversation: dict) -> None`: This method saves the conversation data in the MySQL database.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and their content.
