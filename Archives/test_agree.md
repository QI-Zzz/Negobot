- Deal!
- okay that's understandable I will pay you $110.00 
- I agree to $20.
- $8000 is reasonable. Deal.
- Okay, I could do 4000 but I need more details about the car though please!
- then 380 sounds good thank you.
- you're asking 9000 for it?
- I'm sorry a final offer of what, the $25?
- It's higher than I would like but I suppose that's very reasonable. I will accept the price of 1900.
- I can do that.
- $190 is fine i can do that
- Deal.
- I appreciate that you stand firm. And $10 sounds great. Thank you for doing business.
- $4700 sounds reasonable.
- Ok
- I will pay $250 if I can pick it up today.
- I can pay $90 that is fair
- I can do 225! Sure
- hmm I guess since you allowed my fish to come, I could agree to $2000.
- Well 7000 is too high I can't do that
- Ok you have a deal at 10,000!
- Yes please. I'd be able to go a little higher but not 3500
- Ok
- Sounds fine to me, $2000 it is
- I think I could live with $285.  It's a deal!
- Can you do 50?
- ok
- I guess that will work. $18 it is.
- For $60, can you deliver it?
- Ok let's do it for 90 but you have to promise me that you will deliver the piano to my home, fair enough ?
- With delivery I'd give you the 115. I'm on the outskirts of the city.
- That sounds good to me! $135 it is.
- If the warranty will cover any damage that may occur during transit, I can do $300
- If you throw in the original receipt, so I can have the warranty details, then we have a deal at 60.
- Well I do really need them and they're kind of hard to find...so I can do $6 if you can
- For $9 do you have any leftover photo paper for me to test it?
- Okay that is awesome! I will pick it up today for $9. Thank You
- 5k sounds great too me, send me an offer!
- Okay that sounds reasonable. We will do $40.
- Haha, okay, I can't argue with that logic. $40 it is.
- OK
- Well the place is kind of big. Would you be open to letting me sublet? I can probably get 3 other people to rent the place with me so i can stay in budget and still get you $2700 a month.
- I can do 300 that seems fair enough.  Thank you very much.
- Well at $125 I can't afford to buy any sheets that would fit the matress. Could you throw in a few sheets and I would be wiling to go the $125
- Deal.
- You have a good point.  $5000 is a good deal. 
- Great!
- 265 and free delivery?
- DEAL!
- I can do that.
- ok, i will do 65
- I understand that. If you could bring it to me so I dont have to pay anyone to help me haul it then, I could give 2000 for it. did your sister leave behind her ideas or materials to finish the project?
- deal!
- Yes, I would be willing to buy for $130. It is in excellent shape and feel that is a fair price.
- I could put the deposit down today for $2000. I wanted it a little lower but since I dont have to pay a pet fee I think that is fair. Thank you so much!
- Ok.
- Ok I can do 3000 because I can see that you have done a lot of work to it. 
- I can do 1600 per month 
- Okay then $55 it is. Text me your address when you can and I'll head out there and pick them up. 
- is there a fitness center on site? If I could cancel my gym membership I could swing 2100
- okay great! You have a deal at 2100!
- I can do 1150 for the set! Let me know when's a good time to come pick it up
- Ok sounds good. I will take the lot at 1.75 each. Thanks!
- hmm, okay if you can drop it off to me I can swing 1190.
- deal!
- That could work. I will pay the 2000. Thanks for lowering the price.
- I could only do $30 if you deliver.
- I accept at $160 delivered. 
- $8??
- I can do 23 for it that sounds fair.  Thank You.
- You know what, that's fine. I will do 2000 if thats fine with you since I'm so excited about your views and location.
- I can swing $100. Ill see you this evening?
- It's more then what I wanted to pay but considering it is brand new and unlocked, comes with a 2 year warranty, $450 is fine
- Thank you for the offer, I'd need to stay below $2000 a month with utilities, so unfortunately I don't think it will be a good fit. It's a beautiful place though!
- I could do $1700. And ok I can buy the new car I want. One more question, Is it gated?
- 110 sounds perfect! I will come pick it up tonight!
- okay, since utilities are included i could do 2150. Can I come by to sign a lease tomorrow?
- I could do $95 if you can deliver the desk. Is that possible?
- Hmm, That seems fair. I can do $5500 cash, Youve got yourself a deal. 
- I think that's fair.  I'm willing to pay $4800 for the truck.
